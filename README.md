The mission of this project is to bringing immersive experience to playing with physical toys such as replica guns with sponge bullets. 

Currently, the focus is on making the backend such that there's a way of communication between a master node (which would eventually be able to setup a game between different devices) and the backend itself. 

The predominant languages used in this project would be based upon runime speeds - at the moment, diving into it with Go.

I'll try to keep this space updated. Cheers!
